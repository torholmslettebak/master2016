\subsection{The matrix method}
The matrix method creates an influence line for a specific strain history given a known train with known axle weights and velocity. Thus if the strain signal were recreated given with given parameters, the signal would be a almost exact replica of the measured strain signal, where the differences should originate from sensor noise. The found influence line would however be for this specific train and the passing's dynamic effects on the bridge, which is likely to vary from train to train. Therefore an averaging of a sufficient number of calculated influence lines should reduce or eliminate the dynamic effects from the influence line.

The analysis of the matrix method is based on 4 different train passings, and 3 sensor readings on each passing. The trains in these measurements is of the same type (not entirely shure!!) but the exact weight is not known. The weight of each axle were approximated by distributing carriage and locomotive gross weight. Passengers in the passing trains were not accounted for, and may lead to some deviation from ideal results.

To include effects from the train approach to the bridge, additional samples have been included from the strain signal before and after the first and last peak found in the signal. This will recreate the strain signal to a more complete degree (needs to be shown in a figure), but the found influence line usually displays more dynamic effects which is unwanted properties in a static influence line.

TODO:
\begin{itemize}
\item Show the found influence lines for some sensors
\item discuss the plots
\item reproduce strain signal, and compare with measured signal
\item sout{show averaged influence line}, and perform the same tests
\item show interpolation of this averaged influence line
\item perform the same test with this interpolated influence line
\item the alternative should also be done, interpolate each found influence line and average them, then reproduce the strain signal, and find difference through comparison.
\end{itemize}

As plainly seen in figure \ref{fig:Influence_lines} there is big differences between the found influence lines. The trains are all of the same type meaning that the magnitudes of the influence lines, which should be the mostly dependent on axle weights, ought to be similar for all train passings. However as discussed in \ref{peaks_heights}, the different magnitudes could be explained with the unknown values of axle weights. When the plots are laid on top of each other, as in figure \ref{fig:infl_all_trains}, it is clearly visible that there is some variation in peak magnitude. Especially train 4 and 8 have a higher maximum peak magnitude than the others.

\subsubsection{Accuracy of the matrix method through recreating the strain signal}
One way of examining the accuracy of the matrix method is to recreate the strain signals by using the calculated influence lines. The following three subfigures show recreated signals for a single train passage, but for different sensor locations.

Figure \ref{recreated_sensor_trond_train3} shows a strain signal from the sensor closest to Trondheim along with a signal recreated using the found influence line for that sensor. To identify and compare errors the following equation \ref{fig:recreated_strains}, performing least square error, will be used.
\begin{equation}
	Error = \sum{ (\varepsilon_{meas} - \varepsilon_{calc})^2}
\end{equation}
The recreated strain signals, see figure \ref{fig:recreated_strains}, illustrates the accuracy of the matrix method.

Train 5 is clearly distinctive, in regards of how it oscillates in plot \ref{fig:train5} and how it recreates the strain with error as in table \ref{table:errors}. There are several possible causes for these deviating results, among them wrongly determined velocity of the train and that the trains speed amplifies dynamic effects in the bridge and sensor.

The differences between the unfiltered and filtered errors, tables \ref{table:errors_filtered} and \ref{table:errors_unfiltered} respectively, are clear but not unexpected. They show that the filtering does not distort the error to an amount which destroys the accuracy of the influence line. To really compare the methods of filtering however the found influence lines should be used to calculate axle weights. Averaging of the influence lines gives the following plots.

\subsubsection{Dynamic effects}
The dynamic effects can clearly be seen in the plots for the various train passings. They appear as oscillations in the plots, and are more visible in the low magnitude areas of the influence line. These oscillations vary from train to train making it clear that the dynamic effects depends on the train. The varying influencing factors may be train speed and weight. In the source code producing these influence lines an assumption of train weight has been made, which makes all train axles equal in weight.
What is interesting is the effects of an approaching train, which clearly induces oscillations in the bridge even though the train is as far as 40 meters away from the beginning of the bridge. The differences between the dynamic effects for the train passings may relate to velocity, axle weights and train acceleration (there may be more causes).

A wrongly estimated speed
These dynamic effects are unwanted in the static influence line. In theory, averaging enough influence lines should reduce these effects enough to get usable data. This thesis does not contain enough train passings to achieve this. Also as mentioned before, one of the trains have amplified dynamic effects which throw off the results somewhat when performing averaging. Therefore exluding the results from train 5 as in would be reasonable. Figure \ref{fig:infl_vec_averaged_wo_train5} shows the average of the different influence lines where train 5 has been excluded. This plot still contain dynamic effects, which will need to be removed, but the amplitude of the oscillations have been visibly reduced.

Wrongly determined train velocity is a cause of oscillating influence lines, and can easily be mistaken for dynamic effects. Figure \ref{fig:train5_wrongSpeed} is an example of a influence line determined from a wrongly set speed.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{adjustbox}{center}
		\input{tikz/influenceLines/infl_vec5_wrong_speed.tex}
	\end{adjustbox}
	\caption{Influence line train 5}
	\label{fig:train5_wrongSpeed}
\end{figure}

Shortening the number of samples in the case without train 5, reduces the dynamic effects furter, and a filtering of higher frequencies gives amore usable influence line as seen in \ref{fig:infl_vec_averaged_fft10hz}.
A general formula for identifying influence lines with too much oscillation should be developed. One way could be to use table \ref{table:errors} and exlude the trains which dominates error, or that differs most from the other trains.

The support towards Trondheim is of a special nature, it is connected to a very little bridge spanning perhaps 2 meters which cars may pass under. This may affect the trains entry and cause dynamic effects. It also provides a problem when deciding what should be part of the final influence line, what influences the sensor?
One way to do it would be to simply cut the influence line at the samples corresponding to the bridge, however that does not seem likely to be a very good solution. Another way would be to smooth the influence line to the point where the entry part becomes itegrated with the the major influence line peak.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{adjustbox}{center}
		\input{tikz/influenceLines/infl_vec_all.tex}
	\end{adjustbox}
	\caption{Influence lines from figure:\ref{fig:Influence_lines} on top of each other}
	\label{fig:infl_all_trains}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:infl_all_trains} shows all influence lines in one figure, which highlights the differences and similarities between the figure.

Clearly two of the influence lines, train 4 and train 8 has a maximum peak magnitude which differs from the others. These two trains both travels the bridge in the same direction, which could be a cause for differing magnitudes, however train 6 ,which also travels the same direction, does not follow this trend and in fact aligns with the other peaks of train 3 and 5. Based on this it can be assumed that direction of the train should not affect the magnitude of the maximum peak.

Another hypothesis for the differing peak heights, could be that the trains differ greatly in actual axle weights. A heavy train would cause higher magnitudes of measured strain and the measured strain is what the matrix method uses to find the influence lines. The values of axle weights used to produce the influence lines of the bridge are fixed at the values of a emppty train. A quick study of equation \ref{equation:matrixForm}, shows that increasing the values measured strain also would increase the values of the influence line. This is therefore a likely cause of differing magnitudes. (Look into possibility of identifying this effect in calculated axle weights !!! )

In the execution of the matrix method, the train velocity affects the distance between the

\end{figure}

A possible way to place the found influence line is shown in figure \ref{fig:infl_vec_averaged_wBridge}, which places the influence line in the assumed position on the bridge. The maximum magnitude of the influence line should be found at the sensor location, thusly the averege influence line has been placed in the corrdinate system of the bridge accordingly. There is however the problem of noise, which makes identifying the actual max peak difficult.

Filtering the signals so that a singular smooth maximum peak can be identified. This could distort the actual signal, but will be an interesting approach.

This placement of the first peak and it's influence line also decides the follwoing placement of the influence line which are decided by the axle spacings found by the BWIM system. Therefore a wrongly placed first axle would provide increasing error for each axle found.
Alternatively each influence line could be placed according to the identified axles or bogies. Since the axle distances is known for the signals in this thesis identifying the first axle or bogie and placing the rest
