Master Thesis Bridges - by Tor Holm Slettebak
to compile:
Due to very big figure files this thesis should be compiled with lualatex.
If you dont want that you need to increase memory size and such...



NOTES TO SELF:
TODO:
Filter the signal before applying matrix method.
Compare results found..

Ananlysis... DIscuss dynamic part..
The influence lines should not include dynamic, so discuss how to remove this from the found influence lines..
Either by cutting the found influence line, or by making it zero where it should be zero..

Look at the dynamics, identify frequency of waves.. Comparable with bridge eigenfrequency and so on

Look into optimization if time allows...
