\section{Analysis}

This chapter will describe how the BWIM system performs. What works? Why? How? etc.

Should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare theoretical and calculated influence lines. Also include influence lines found through Abaqus.
\item Check how influence lines found through matrix method and optimization reproduces the strain history
\item Test obtained influence line by running the bwim routine on the hitherto unused freight train. (Depends on getting info about the train). Also Do this test on the other trains.
\end{itemize}
