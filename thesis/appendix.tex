\section{Dynamics}
A train traversing a railway bridge creates actions in longitudinal, lateral, and vertical directions. Braking and traction from a passing train causes longitudinal forces
Rocking, or rotations around an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bridge, and vertical dynamic forces are created by structure-track-vehicle conditions and interactions.
\subsection{Rocking and vertical dynamic forces}
Lateral rocking of moving vehicles provide amplification of vertical  wheel loads. This amplification increases the stresses in the members supporting the track.

Superstructure-vehicle interaction creates a vertical dynamic amplification of moving loads, which will result in vibrations causing additional stresses in members supporting the track.

The unloaded simply supported beam frequency $\omega_1 = \frac{\pi^2}{L^2}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{m}}$, provides a basic indicator of superstructure vertical dynamic response.
