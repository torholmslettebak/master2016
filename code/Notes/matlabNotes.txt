% TODO ????
% Create "perfect" influence line for a given strain history
% where the properties of the train are given (axle spacing, axle weights,
% train speed osv)
% The location of strain sensor is also known..

% SO far this code finds a decent approximization of the theoretical
% influence lines. It starts with a too high value, and accumulates more
% error for each axle added to the bridge. This error comes from smoothing
% of the noisy strain signal which results in a loss of edges in the
% signal. This leads to a too curvy signal. The result of this can easily
% be seen when studying the extremal points of the influence line, the
% beginning, maximum and the end.

% There is a possibility that it is possible to improve the results from 
% the matrix method by constraining the influence line from the known values. 

% Add simple dynamics to the model.. only one or two sine waves to distort
% signal

% Optimization
% fminuc
% interpolating a polynomial

% TODO - OPTIMIZATION
% How ?
% we have a strain signal and the vehicle properties
% And we have an idea of how the influence line is supposed to be
% Through the fminuc function and the desired properties of the influence
% line, the best case influence line can be calculated.. The function does
% this by comparing given strain signal with calculated strain signal 
% this is done through: 
% sum(signal-generated_signal)^2
% the properties of the influence line which minimizes this gives us the
% best result. SEE NOTES FROM DANIEL FOR MORE VISUAL INFORMATION.



% TODO - Improving optimization
Up til now the generated influence line only depends on one parameter, 
this will probably not be sufficient especially for more complex influence lines.
First I will try a linear relationship, however alternaative influence line 
made from alternative polynomials could be even better. Splines or something


Optimizaion now works well, the linear method creates a influence line no matter numer of data points.
The poly method creates a decent influence line, more similar to how the matrix method's influence line looks..
Same shape, and same problem towards the beginning and end of the influence line. 
The method of optimization seems to work well despite noise.


TODO - Fix the matrix method by constraining it such that the beginning and end of influence line becomes zero..
This can maybe be done through constraing the equation... Or, maybe it's possible to do some sort of optimization on this solution.



TODO - Account for traindata from sensors.
This means modifying the code so that it reads the appropriate data from the files.
Sketch of one of the trains are given in the ../train/ folder. This should give enough info to make TrainData in matlab.. also data from the cad model will be needed to find the length of the measurement section. One possible problem is that the measurement section is not at the bridges midspan. The beam which is measured  is in the first section of the bridge, making it part of a continuous beam. This might not be a problem, but most likely.
